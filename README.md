# Explanation:
### Usage of Technologies
The entire project is written in C#.
The database is an XML file, and the UI is written in WPF.

### Architecture
The project is built on a three-tier architecture:
- **Presentation tier:** The top layer responsible for user display, such as product catalogs, order tracking, etc.
- **Application tier:** The business logic layer, controlling the application's functionality and responsible for processing data returned from the presentation and data tiers and communication between them.
- **Data tier:** The data layer, where information is retrieved, updated, and stored independently, not related to the logical layer.

### Design Patterns
The project uses many design patterns, including:
- **Factory -** 
- **Singelton -** 
- **Lazy initialization -** 
- **Thread safe -** 

### About the application name
We decided to name our application dotNet5783_7729_0796:
dotNet, of course, because that's the framework that support C# language.
5783 - because it is the *gematria* of the Hebrew year in which we wrote the project.
7729_0796 - are the endings of our identification numbers.
